### ðŸŒ· Kayisha Ulysse

**`Creative Craftswoman (Developer & Designer)`**

I am a creative Software engineer with a passion for design, environment and Web3. Thinking creatively outside of the box, abstract conceptualization of designs and code and translating it to practical use is a talent I take pride in. All coding projects are built ground up, from ideation to problem solving execution. I love creativing solutions/apps that solve real-life problems. All about collaborative environments, and I am a big advocate for diversity and inclusion of Black and LatinX into Tech/Web3 spaces.
